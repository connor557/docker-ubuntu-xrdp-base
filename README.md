# docker-ubuntu-xrdp-base

Based on the Ubuntu `phusion/baseimage:0.9.16`, this adds Xrdp 0.9 and associated service files for `xrdp` and `xrdp-sesman`.

It could do with updating.

Build with `./build.sh` and sit tight, but it's better to use it as a base for your own Dockerfile to add a desktop environment and applications.
